# adapt-esdc-simulation

**Simulation** is a *question/action component* for Adapt.

The Systems Simulation Component is an effective tool for creating interactive, hands-on simulations that allow learners to practice data entry and system navigation in a safe, immersive environment. By using screenshots of system interfaces and adding interactive elements like text inputs, dropdown menus, and buttons, it enables learners to apply their knowledge and receive immediate feedback. This makes it ideal for workplace training, as it helps users develop the skills to effectively navigate and use software systems while providing a valuable opportunity for validation of their learning.

## Features

- **Interactive Hands-On Learning:** Allows learners to interact directly with system interfaces by simulating actions like entering text, selecting options, or clicking buttons.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on user actions, reinforcing learning through trial and error.
- **Customizable Actions:** Configurable elements such as clickable areas, dropdown menus, input fields, and date pickers help simulate real-life interactions with a system.
- **Risk-Free Practice:** Learners can make mistakes and learn from them without any real-world consequences, making the learning process safe and supportive.
- **Versatile Use Cases:** Suitable for training scenarios where learners need to practice specific system functionalities, from data entry to navigating complex workflows.
